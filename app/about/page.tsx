      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi, I’m Nathan Ferdowski. I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a degree in Computer Engineering. Since then, I've worked as a software developer at <strong>AT&T</strong> and <strong>SkillStorm</strong>, where I contributed to building scalable systems and enterprise applications.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Outside of work, I’m deeply interested in <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> and love analyzing, trading, and investing in digital assets. I’ve been building tools to track and visualize crypto performance and market trends.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I’m also a big sports fan — particularly <strong>soccer</strong> and <strong>golf</strong>. I enjoy following leagues, stats, and sometimes building apps around them (like my Premier Fantasy App).
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm always looking to learn, build, and connect with others in the tech, finance, and sports analytics space.
      </p>
